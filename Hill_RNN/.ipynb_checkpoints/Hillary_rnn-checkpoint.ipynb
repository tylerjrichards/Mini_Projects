    "In the Fall of 2016, a month before the election, a list of tried and rejected slogans for the Hillary Clinton campaign were leaked via email to the press. I thought these slogans were super interesting, with some of my favorites being \"Fairness worth the fight\" or \"New Solutions Real Results.\" Naturally, twitter had a field day and we all had a bit of fun.  \n",

    "So below, over the course of about an hour, I built a RNN using @minimaxir's textgenrnn for this exact purpose. Turns out, this library is aggressively easy to use, making this a great intro to textgen RNNs. "
